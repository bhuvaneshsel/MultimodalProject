            <h1>Food Insecurity</h1>
            <p> Food insecurity is a problem that affects people across the world.
                People struggling with food insecurity lack access to nutritious foods on a daily basis.
                This problem can negatively affect the physical and mental health of people if not adressed.

                <p><a href="https://www.shfb.org/" target="_blank">Second Harvest of Silicon Valley </a>is an
                    organization working to deal with the food insecurity problem.
                    They have many food banks and distribution centers in Silicon Valley. In the distribution centers,

                <h1>WHAT I DID</h1>
                <p>I volunteered at one of Second Harvest's food bank.
                    I worked on packing food into boxes that passed along a
                    conveyor belt. Other times, I sorted bad food from good food.

            <h1>IMPACT</h1>
            <p>By volunteering at a food bank, I was able to help my community
                as the food that I was packing would be given to people in need. At the end
                of each volunteer session, they would announce how many pounds of food we packed
                and I always felt proud of the work I was doing.</p>
